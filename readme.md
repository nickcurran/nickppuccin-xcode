# Nickppucin Xcode

Handmade version of [Catppuccin Latte theme for Xcode](https://github.com/catppuccin/xcode) as the original didn't work in some cases (e.g., markdown files). This is essentially the Xcode Default (Light) Theme with most of the colors from Catppuccin Latte applied. YMMV. Also uses the [SauceCodePro Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads).
